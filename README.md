### Part of [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Back End Development and APIs Certificate

Note: This project was built in progress for the <strong>freeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs Projects Certificate</strong>. This was for <strong>project #5</strong>. This is a clone of the freeCodeCamp boilerplate repo from Github. The clone only included the starting packages and initial code. I had to build the actually API by myself, following the user stories and technical requirements requested by freeCodeCamp.


# Challenge?
## To Build a URL Shortener Microservice

## User Stories To Fullfill

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://file-metadata-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

- Clone [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-filemetadata/https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-urlshortener/) and complete your project locally.
- Use [our Replit starter project](https://replit.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-filemetadata) to complete your project.
- Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

If you use Replit, follow these steps to set up the project:

- Start by importing the project on Replit.
- Next, you will see a ```.replit``` window.
- Select ```Use run command``` and click the ```Done``` button.


When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the ```Solution Link``` field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the ```GitHub``` Link field.

HINT: You can use the ```multer``` npm package to handle file uploading.

## Technical Requirements

- You should provide your own project, not the example URL.

- You can submit a form that includes a file upload.

- The form file input field has the ```name``` attribute set to ```upfile```.

- When you submit a file, you receive the file ```name```, ```type```, and ```size``` in bytes within the JSON response.
